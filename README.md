Task Manager

Task Manager is a Java Full Stack Web Application that I built in under 5 hours, based on a wireframe I had never seen before.
The main focus of the exam is implementing specific features, including validations for the login and registration forms.
The exams are graded on functionality only, not looks, so CSS is minimal due to time constraints.

Task Manager allows users to create tasks and delegate them to other registered users, along with assigning a task priority.

The dashboard shows all the incomplete tasks, the delegator, the asignee, and the priority.

If the logged in user is the delegator, the task page will allow them to edit or delete the selected task.

if the logged in user is the asignee, the task page will allow them to mark the task as complete.
This action will also remove the current task from the database.
